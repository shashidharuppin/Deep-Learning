    "Transfer learning generally refers to a process where a model trained on one problem is used in some way on a second related problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep learning, transfer learning is a technique whereby a neural network model is first trained on a problem similar to the problem that is being solved. One or more layers from the trained model are then used in a new model trained on the problem of interest.\n",
    "Transfer learning has the benefit of decreasing the training time for a neural network model and can result in lower generalization error."
